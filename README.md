Welcome to my Python learning journey!  
This repository contains **practice programs, mini-projects, and experiments** created while building a strong foundation in Python — from basic syntax to functional programming.

---

## 📂 Repository Overview

The repository is organized into topic-based folders.  
Each folder contains multiple small programs focused on a single Python concept.

---

### **✅ Topics Covered So Far**

#### **Strings**
- Practiced a variety of **string methods** such as `upper()`, `lower()`, `strip()`, `replace()`, `split()`, `join()`, `find()`, `count()`, etc.
- Programs include: palindrome checkers, substring search, word frequency, and formatting exercises.

#### **Lists**
- Manual list reversal without built-in functions
- Frequency of each element  
- Finding the second largest number  
- Removing duplicates  
- Sorting techniques (manual & using `sort()`/`sorted()`)

#### **Dictionaries**
- Initial exploration of dictionary basics (adding, updating, deleting key-value pairs)  
- Work in progress — more programs to be added soon

#### **Conditionals**
- Simple and nested `if-else` programs  
- Decision-making exercises with multiple conditions

#### **Loops**
- `for` loops, `while` loops  
- Range-based iterations, nested loops, and loop control statements (`break`, `continue`, `pass`)

#### **Functions**
- Yet to be fully explored — planned for upcoming updates

## 🛠 Mini Projects

- **Calculator (Loop-Based)** — Continuously performs calculations until the user exits  
- **Calculator (If-Else Based)** — Basic arithmetic operations using conditional branching
- **Shopping cart (List operations, Loops-Based)** — Performs actions based off of users choices
- More small projects to be added as learning progresses
